Here are some open resources related to reproducibility, and modeling:

## Reproducible Science

Introduction to reproducible science practices ([repo](https://github.com/Mar-Cald/repro-pre-school), [slide](https://mar-cald.github.io/repro-pre-school/slide/repro-preschool.html#/title-slide))

-   Write transparent, script-based analyses in R

-   Organize your projects using functional and modular workflows

-   Track your work with Git and collaborate via GitHub

-   Share datasets responsibly using FAIR principles

-   Create fully reproducible papers and reports with Quarto

## PAM: Predictive Accumulation Models

This project implements the PAM framework <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.13203> in R/Stan. Combine predictive processes with evidence accumulation models, [repo](https://github.com/Mar-Cald/PAM-PredictiveAccumulationModels).

## Reaction time distributions
