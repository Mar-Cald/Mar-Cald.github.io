Here are some open resources related to reproducibility, and modeling:

## Reproducible Science

Introduction to reproducible science practices ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mar-Cald/repro-pre-school){target="_blank"}, [slide](https://mar-cald.github.io/repro-pre-school/slide/repro-preschool.html#/title-slide){target="_blank"})

-   Write transparent, script-based analyses in R
-   Organize your projects using functional and modular workflows
-   Track your work with Git and collaborate via GitHub
-   Share datasets responsibly using FAIR principles
-   Create fully reproducible papers and reports with Quarto

## PAM: Predictive Accumulation Models

This project implements the [PAM framework](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.13203){target="_blank"} in R/Stan. Combine predictive processes with evidence accumulation models, [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mar-Cald/PAM-PredictiveAccumulationModels){target="_blank"}.

## Reaction time distributions
