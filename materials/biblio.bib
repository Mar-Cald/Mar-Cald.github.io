    abstract = { 1. If a set of observations are analysed for a new parameter a, which is initially as likely as not to be zero, and the possible range of whose values is s if it is not zero, we can denote the proposition that it is 0 by q, and the proposition that it is not 0 by ~ q. Then the prior probabilities of q and ~ q are given by P(q | h) = P (~ q | h) = ½, (1) and the posterior probabilities on data θ are shown, by an approximate argument (Jeffreys 1937b, p. 250), to be given by K = P(q | θh)/P(~q | θh) / P(q | h)/P(~q | h) = s/√(2π) σαexp( - α2/2σα2), (2) where α is the maximum likelihood solution for a and σα its standard error. Since s is initially fixed and σα decreases like n-½ when n, the number of observations, increases, the outside factor is proportional to √n. If K is less than 1, the observations support the introduction of the new parameter; if K is more than 1 they do not. In the cases so far examined the critical value of α/σα ranges from about 1·8 to 3 as the number of observations rises from 5 to 5000. }

This paper extends these comparisons to multiple testing and in particular to the Bonferroni multiple testing method, in which p-values are adjusted by multiplying by k, the number of tests considered. In the Bayesian setting, prior assessments may need to be adjusted to account for multiple hypotheses, resulting in corresponding adjustments to the posterior probabilities. Conditions are given for which the adjusted posterior probabilities roughly correspond to Bonferroni adjusted p-values.},

abstract = {Bayes factors provide a symmetrical measure of evidence for one model versus another (e.g. H1 versus H0) in order to relate theory to data. These properties help solve some (but not all) of the problems underlying the credibility crisis in psychology. The symmetry of the measure of evidence means that there can be evidence for H0 just as much as for H1; or the Bayes factor may indicate insufficient evidence either way. P-values cannot make this three-way distinction. Thus, Bayes factors indicate when the data count against a theory (and when they count for nothing); and thus they indicate when replications actually support H0 or H1 (in ways that power cannot). There is every reason to publish evidence supporting the null as going against it, because the evidence can be measured to be just as strong either way (thus the published record can be more balanced). Bayes factors can be B-hacked but they mitigate the problem because a) they allow evidence in either direction so people will be less tempted to hack in just one direction; b) as a measure of evidence they are insensitive to the stopping rule; c) families of tests cannot be arbitrarily defined; and d) falsely implying a contrast is planned rather than post hoc becomes irrelevant (though the value of pre-registration is not mitigated).}

,abstract = { P values have been critiqued on several grounds but remain entrenched as the dominant inferential method in the empirical sciences. In this article, we elaborate on the fact that in many statistical models, the one-sided P value has a direct Bayesian interpretation as the approximate posterior mass for values lower than zero. The connection between the one-sided P value and posterior probability mass reveals three insights: (1) P values can be interpreted as Bayesian tests of direction, to be used only when the null hypothesis is known from the outset to be false; (2) as a measure of evidence, P values are biased against a point null hypothesis; and (3) with N fixed and effect size variable, there is an approximately linear relation between P values and Bayesian point null hypothesis tests. }

abstract = {Several approaches have been proposed to correct point-wise significance thresholds used in interval-mapping genome scans. A method for significance threshold correction based on the Bonferroni test is presented. This test involves calculating the effective number of independent comparisons performed in a genome scan from the variance of the eigenvalues of the observed marker correlation matrix. The more highly correlated the markers, the higher the variance of the eigenvalues and the lower the number of independent tests performed on a chromosome. This approach was evaluated by mapping 1000 normally distributed phenotypes along chromosomes of varying length and marker density in a population size of 500. Experiment-wise significance thresholds obtained from the simulation are compared to those calculated using the Bonferroni criterion and the newly developed measure of the effective number of independent tests in a genome scan. The Bonferroni calculation produced significance thresholds very similar to those obtained by simulation. The threshold levels for both Bonferroni and simulation analysis depended strongly on the marker density and size of chromosomes. There was a slight bias of about 1\% in the thresholds obtained at the 5\% and 10\% point-wise significance levels. The method introduced here provides a relatively simple correction for multiple comparisons that can be easily calculated using standard statistics packages.},
