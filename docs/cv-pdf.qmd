# Organizational Activities

## Methodological School: Replicability Crisis in Science

Member of the **Organizing team**. The school aims to provide a
broad and interdisciplinary perspective on replicability, along with
tools that help participants explore aspects most relevant to their own
field. Lectures cover the epistemological, philosophical, and
statistical foundations of replicability and the so-called replication
crisis. Students engage in guided group activities to discuss core
issues and apply the course concepts to real data analysis. Padova
(Italy). (<https://psicostat.github.io/replicability-psy-unipd-phd>)

-   **Lecturers**: Prof. Branden Fitelson, Prof. Giovanni Parmigiani,
    Dr. Filippo Gambarota

## International Winter School - The 4 Ms: Meta-research, Measurement, Multi-lab, and Multiverse data analysis in Behavioral Sciences

Member of the **Organizing team**. The Winter School aims to
address the methodological challenges in behavioral sciences, which
impact theory, measurement, and data analysis. Its main purpose is to
introduce attendees to advancements in meta-research, providing both
theoretical insights and practical tools to conduct rigorous research.
Additionally, it aims to foster collaborative networks by enabling
attendees to discuss their ongoing projects with teachers and peers,
facilitating new collaborations and the application of the presented
tools. Padova (Italy). (<https://winterschool4ms.dpg.unipd.it/>)
